# Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS)

## Overview
The Smart Home Energy Management System is a full-stack Spring Boot web application designed to monitor, control, automate, and optimize household energy consumption.

The project follows a modular architecture and simulates a real-world smart energy platform with authentication, device management, real-time energy tracking, analytics, automation, and admin policy enforcement.

## System Modules

### Module 1 – Role Based Authentication
Provides secure login, registration, role-based access control, and password recovery.

### Module 2 – Smart Device Management
Handles device registration, control, and ownership management.

### Module 3 – Real-Time Energy Tracking
Calculates and stores energy consumption generated by devices.

### Module 4 – Analytics Dashboard
Transforms energy data into user and admin insights.

### Module 5 – Scheduling and Automation
Automates device operations using background schedulers.

### Final Integrated System
Combines all modules into a complete working application.

## How to Run the Final Integrated System

1. Create database
```
CREATE DATABASE shems;
```

2. Configure database in:
```
SHEMS_Final_Integrated_System/src/main/resources/application.properties
```

3. Run the application
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Open in browser
```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Background Automation

Schedulers run automatically to:
- Execute device schedules
- Enforce admin energy policies
- Update energy consumption

---

## Project Outcome
This project demonstrates a complete enterprise-style Spring Boot application using modular architecture, secure authentication, background schedulers, and data-driven analytics.
