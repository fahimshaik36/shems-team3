# Module 3 – Real-Time Energy Tracking

## Overview
This module is responsible for monitoring, calculating, and storing energy consumption generated by smart devices in the Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS).

It converts device usage into measurable energy data that is later used by the analytics, scheduling, and policy enforcement modules.

---

## Purpose of the Module
Smart devices continuously consume electricity. This module tracks that consumption in real time and stores historical records so the system can analyze usage patterns and optimize energy efficiency.

---

## Core Responsibilities
- Track device usage duration
- Calculate energy consumption
- Store daily and historical energy records
- Provide energy data for analytics dashboards
- Provide energy data for admin policy enforcement
- Generate data for PDF energy reports

---

## Energy Calculation Logic
Energy consumption is calculated using:

```
Energy (kWh) = Power Rating (kW) × Usage Duration (hours)
```

This calculation runs continuously as device states change.

## Technology Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- Maven
